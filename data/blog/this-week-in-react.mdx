## ⚛️ React

### [Next.js 13.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4)

##### A major release for Next.js, with:

- App Router (stable): the new router based on Suspense and Server Components is ready for production.
- Turbopack (beta): the new bundler is stabilizing in dev, and prod build is coming soon.
- Server Actions (alpha): Next.js integration of the latest React innovations.
  The blog post shows many notable differences with the old router: conventions, nested layouts, selective hydration, server components, code splitting...

It also unveils the new React innovations to manage mutations and form submissions, whose integration in Next.js gives birth to Server Actions. This greatly simplifies interactions with the server without the need to create an API route and the use of forms supporting progressive enhancement. It is now possible to create and distribute full-stack React components.

Note that it is a bit early to adopt Server Actions in production. They are in alpha, and you could unexpectedly expose a secret captured in a Server Action closure to the client. Details here:

##### 🧵 [Thread](https://twitter.com/tomus_sherman/status/1654198731313500174) warns of this issue

##### 🎥 [Next's Server Actions Might Not Be That Safe...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdKcbyEK66M)

📖 New [Next.js documentation:](https://nextjs.org/docs) the new beta doc is deployed in production. I advise in particular to read React Essentials.

👀 [useOptimistic](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions#experimental-useoptimistic) and [useFormStatus](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions#experimental-useformstatus): new React experimental hooks.

📜 React Canaries: Enabling Incremental Feature Rollout Outside Meta: the React team presenting a new canary release channel which allows frameworks to adopt new React features before their official stable release. The canary releases are stable enough to be adopted in production. This is what Next.js App Router uses now, but also what Meta and React-Native always relied on.

📜 React Server Components, Next.js App Router and examples: Addy Osmani shares his notes and reflections on Server Components. A good overview, as well as many examples of open-source apps. Also lists reasons to stop using Create-React-App.

📜 5 Lessons Learned From Taking Next.js App Router to Production: feedback from Inngest who successfully migrated a CRA app to Next.js and App Router. There are some interesting details about caching or search parameters.

📜 Server-side rendering React in OCaml: Ahrefs devs use Reason-React. They reimplemented ReactDOMServer.renderToString in OCaml to be able to run the SSR natively and solve some of their issues. Their SSR is now 10x faster than Node.js and 6x faster than Bun. The idea of running SSR natively is very interesting, but it will take a lot of work to support the latest innovations like streaming and Server Components.

📜 HTMX is the Future: a critique of SPA frameworks, in particular React. Proposes to use an alternative: HTMX and hypermedia responses. I find it interesting for backend devs who want to add interactivity without doing JavaScript, but not sure that it scales that well.

📜 Context, Composition, and Flexibility: proposes to use the React context to activate an alternative rendering of a component on a whole subtree.

📜 My Struggle With Remix: interesting feedback. The author still loves Remix, but presents some challenges encountered while using it.
