## Courses

These are some popular courses:

- [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
- [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)

A course that's more intermediate level:

- [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/)

This one is not free, but it's not very expensive either. I've taken a look at the full course and I can say it uses some very interesting and useful approaches and metaphors to explain JavaScript concepts. The author is a lead React developer and has a reputation for explaining things clearly.
