# Dunbar's Number

Proposed by anthropologist Robin Dunbar, Dunbar's Number is a theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom an individual can maintain stable social relationships. This concept is based on the idea that there are limits to the human brain's capacity for social bonding and interaction.

## Specifically, Dunbar proposed different layers of social relationships based on group size:

### Close Relationships (5)

At the innermost layer are the closest relationships, typically consisting of about 5 individuals. These are people with whom we have strong emotional bonds, such as family members or very close friends.

### Sympathy Group (15)

The next layer consists of about 15 individuals. These are people with whom we have frequent contact and feel a sense of kinship or camaraderie. They may include close friends and extended family members.

### Social Cohort (50)

Beyond the sympathy group are approximately 50 individuals. These are people with whom we have more casual interactions, such as regular social acquaintances, colleagues, or members of shared interest groups.

### Community (150)

The outermost layer is the community, consisting of about 150 individuals. This is the maximum number of people with whom an individual can maintain meaningful, stable relationships. In traditional human societies, this might represent a small village or tribe.

Dunbar's Number suggests that our cognitive capacity places constraints on the size and complexity of our social networks. Beyond a certain point, it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain meaningful relationships with additional individuals. This concept has been supported by various studies across different cultures and contexts, although the exact number may vary slightly.

In the context of startups and organizations, Dunbar's Number is often cited to highlight the challenges of maintaining a cohesive culture and effective communication as a company grows beyond a certain size. When a company exceeds Dunbar's Number, it becomes more difficult for employees to know each other well, resulting in potential communication bottlenecks, decreased trust, and a greater reliance on formal structures and processes to manage interactions. Therefore, understanding Dunbar's Number can inform strategies for managing organizational growth, fostering relationships, and preserving a sense of community within larger teams.
